# Project Skeleton
------------
we have serveral directories and files. let's talk about them:
1- Config : contains all static information for project like database settings and jwt token secret
2- Middleware : check token and signup before controller
3- Controllers : control inputs and validate them for reserve and check login informations
4- Models : contains Models (User and Resreve) objects with their own fields (Sequelize ORM Objects)
5- Views : contains all templates and their depandancies (style.css and converter.js). we use these templates late in routing part (Rendering)
6- Routes : Reserve and auth Routes



# Config
------------
auth.config.js -> this file contain JWT Token Secret key and we used this file in auth.Jwt.js and auth.controller.js
reserve.config.js -> this file contain reserve settings. Resreve Period (time_period) and Maximum Resreve day distance from today (day_period)
db.config.js -> this file contain all information about our mysql database system (login credits and timezone and pool settings) -> for more information please visite the file



# Middleware
------------
authJwt.js -> this file has two methods :
    1 - isValidToken (Return True or False) -> check if given token is valid or not
    2 - verifyToken (Return Status and Set User ID based on TOKEN)

verifySignup.js -> this file has two methods and one function :
    1- check function as it seems, check if given username or email are already taken or not (Return True or False)
    2- usernameOrEmailExists (For API Results) -> use check function and send json message to the use-agent
    3- usernameOrEmailExistsFront (For Front Results) -> use check function and redirect user to proper route

index.js -> merge verifySignup and authJwt into one module



# Controllers
------------
auth.controller.js -> this file contains three methods : 
    1 - signup (For api) : this
